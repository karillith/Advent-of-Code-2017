# Advent-of-Code-2017

Results and notes from the [2017 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017)

Written mostly in PHP (as that is (1) what I'm currently using at work and (2) what I am most familiar with at this point), but some of them are done by hand (see appropriate readmes for my by-hand "logic", that I hope to then implement with code).

Unfortunately I've dropped off the face off the earth with this because of being out and about... excuses excuses. I'd like to pick this back up throughout 2018 and "finish" it by the time Advent of Code 2018 comes around :)
